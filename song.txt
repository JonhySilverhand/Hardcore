Rip it then slip in your body bag
Shake it then dip, I'm out of there
Poppin' the drop, I got his ass
That don't concern me
I would be nothin' without the past
Drippin' it, I'm whippin' it out the dash
I do this shit without the mask
If you try to burn me, I will come back as a skull made of ashes
Dark shadow blunts smokin' excel magic
Lookin' like Christ, got light with the passion
I will leave you and yours livin' off rations

Tick tock go the Glock at the drop of a penny
Thought you heard a creak in the floorboard [?]
Poltergeist Bones [?] with the business
Eject button, now you're out of commission
Long hair swingin' like one of my bitches
